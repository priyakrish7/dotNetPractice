   For suppose you are given two string s + "dice", p = "iced"
   
   Your mission is to find if they are anagrams are not.
   
   Two words can be called as anagrams if both words are made of same characters and same character counts
   
   for suppose the words iced and dice are called anagrams since 
   
   iced --> i: 1, c: 1, e: 1, d: 1
   dice --> d: 1, i: 1, c: 1, e: 1
   
   Complete the function anagrams and return a boolean value stating true or false
