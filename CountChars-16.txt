/*
   For suppose given a string s = "rudradeva"
   
   Your mission is to find the character count of each character in that string
   
   Sample output would look something like this.
   
   r: 2, u: 1, d: 2, a: 2, e:1, v:1 
   
   Note: The order of the characters in the output doesn't matter.
   
      r: 2, u: 1,  e:1, v:1 , d: 2, a: 2, --> this output also is correct one.
