    Suppose you are given an array 
    
    [1,2,3,4, 7, 9, 11];
    
    you mission is to find two numbers whose sum will be equal to the given target.
    
    For the above array, if target is 11, then output can be either 
    [2,9] or [7, 4] 
    
    But the answer can't be 11 because, 11 is a single number and we need to have atleast two numbers in the output.
    
    If you can't find the target through any pair return [-1, -1]
